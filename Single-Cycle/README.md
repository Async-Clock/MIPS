# Single Cycle MIPS CPU
This repository contains a single cycle MIPS CPU implemented in verilog. The CPU implements a subset of MIPS instructions including many I-type and R-type instructions, as well as load and store instructions (lw and sw). This project was done as a final project for ECE 329 - Computer Architecture at Southern Illinois University.
